# Hi, I'm AndrÃ©s Sanabria ðŸ‘‹


I'm a frontend developer. I obsess over good design & shipping products fast.

Take a look at some of the things I've built:

- :movie_camera: **[DÃ³ndeVeo](https://www.dondeveo.co/)**: A web app for searching in which streaming service a movie or TV show is.
- :books: **[Poetry blog](https://www.poesiauniandes.com/)**: A blog for the poetry group of Universidad de los Andes. I wanted to try something different, so I built it using the Astro framework.
- :sunny: **[Personal portfolio website](https://www.jandrev.com/)**: Portfolio for showcasing my projects.
