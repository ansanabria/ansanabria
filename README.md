# Hi, I'm AndrÃ©s Sanabria ðŸ‘‹


I'm a frontend developer. I obsess over good design & shipping products fast.

Take a look at some of the things I've built:

- :movie_camera: **StreamFinder**: A web app for searching in which streaming service a movie or TV show is.  
- :books: **Poetry blog**: A blog for the poetry group of Universidad de los Andes. I wanted to try something different, so I built it using the Astro framework.
- :sunny: **Personal portfolio website**: Portfolio for showcasing my projects.
